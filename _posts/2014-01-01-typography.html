    <p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve stories by <a href="#">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, featuring his famous detective and illustrated by Sidney Paget. The 1939 film starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce was based on the stage play by William Gillette and was not a direct adaptation of the book.</p>
    <p>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>
